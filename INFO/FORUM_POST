[WEB/ADMIN/SQL] SQLcraft - a PHP driven web-app for administrating databases - 0.1.0

[B][SIZE=7]SQLcraft[/SIZE][/B][SIZE=7]: [COLOR=green]0.1.1[/COLOR][/SIZE]

[SIZE=5]INTRODUCTION[/SIZE]
What is SQLcraft, you might ask? SQLcraft is a PHP-driven web-application in early development that is geared specifically towards administrating the MySQL and SQLite databases that Bukkit powered servers tend to use. The goal of the project is to create a modular web-application that's lightweight yet powerful. The project is free, open source, and welcomes collaborators. The modular design of SQLcraft makes it extremely easy for others to create modules and drop them into SQLcraft with zero config necessary to add them. You can find the GitHub repo [url=https://github.com/Jekotia/SQLcraft]here[/url].

[size=5]INSTALLATION[/size]
	[IMPORTANT] YOU are responsible for securing this from unauthorized use until I create a login/authorization system. I recomend using htaccess+htpasswd or equivalent; you can find a good tutorial on htaccess and htpasswd [url=http://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/howto/auth.html]here[/url].
	Extract the SQLcraft folder to a web-accessible location on your server. If you put SQLcraft on your Minecraft server, this will likely be something like /var/www/, or a variation that refers to httpd, html_public, etc. Configure the variables in config.php to your liking. Some modules will include their own configuration file to set variables only they use.

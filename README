INTRODUCTION
SQLcraft is a suite of PHP scripts designed to ease Minecraft administration tasks that require delving into a database.

FEATURES
*View KiwiAdmin's banlist table and add bans
	*Ban removal is planned

INSTALLATION
At this time installation is only possible if you make your own auth.php file in the SQLcraft folder with sufficient data to connect to a MySQL database. This should be fixed soon with a proper configuration file.

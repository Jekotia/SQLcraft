INTRODUCTION
	SQLcraft is a PHP web-application currently in early development.
	The goal of the project is to create a modular web-panel to ease the administration of MySQL and SQLite databases used by Minecraft servers.
	The project is free, open source, and welcomes collaborators. 

FEATURES
	View KiwiAdmin's banlist table and add bans

TODO
	Add unban functionality to the KiwiAdmin module
	For lack of a better term, get command injection working on linux to automatically recache the banlist from MySQL when a change is made

INSTALLATION
	Download the files and set your configuration in config.php

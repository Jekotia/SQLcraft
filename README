INTRODUCTION
	SQLcraft is a PHP web-application currently in early development.
	The goal of the project is to create a modular web-panel to ease the administration of MySQL and SQLite databases used by Minecraft servers.
	The project is free, open source, and welcomes collaborators. 

FEATURES
	KiwiAdmin Module
		View the banlist table
		Add bans to the MySQL database table
		Remove bans from the MySQL database table
		*LINUX ONLY* Send 'reloadka' to server whenever a record is added or removed from the database 

TODO
	Feature requests (mainly plugins to support)
	Home and Warp converters for moving between home and warp plugins without losing data
	Basic theme so it isn't as ugly
	Directory-based navigation menu generation

INSTALLATION
	[IMPORTANT] YOU are responsible for securing this from unauthorized use until I create a login/authorization system. I recomend using htaccess+htpasswd or equivalent; you can find a good tutorial on htaccess and htpasswd [url=http://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/howto/auth.html]here[/url].
	Extract the SQLcraft folder to a web-accessible location on your server. If you put SQLcraft on your Minecraft server, this will likely be something like /var/www/, or a variation that refers to httpd, html_public, etc. Configure the variables in config.php to your liking. Some modules will include their own configuration file to set variables only they use.

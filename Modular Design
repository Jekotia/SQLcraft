SQLcraft will mainly use directory structure and PHP loops/includes in order to
achieve the modular design of the project. This file is both a personal reference
on how to structure the project, as well as a reference for those that wish to help.
Not all of the referenced files exist yet; this reference is intended to be future
proof so that scripts do not need to be updated later.

The files '/tpl1.php' and '/tpl2.php' contains all of the template HTML for SQLcraft,
and the navigation menu is generated based on directory names under the '/modules/'
directory. '/init.php' is the 'initialization' script that contains the configuration data,
connects to the MySQL database, if any, and checks if the user is logged in. The contents
of the '/auth/' folder handles user authentication.

This makes adding modules a drag-and-drop operation.

This is still a WIP and any feedback/suggestions on the structure would be greatly appreciated.

Core modules will be found in the root folder and while removable, it is HIGHLY recommended they are not removed.

Current core modules: User Authentication
